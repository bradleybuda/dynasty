# TODO
# - measure win rate by starting position, see if we need to correct
# - measure historic player value by draft position
#   - does it vary over rounds? probably
#   - teach AI to use it
# - implement human trade propsals
# - more interesting trades (include players in trade, multiple picks on each side
# - make it run faster
# - AI passes too soon in round 1. should try harder to make the opponent spend cards, even if likely / guaranteed to lose
# - vector of per-season discount rates rather than one fixed rate
# - allow UI to trade later picks
